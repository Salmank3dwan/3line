    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p> Founded in 2009, 3 Lines Restaurant has become a beloved name in Bahrain's fast-casual dining scene. Our vision was to create a unique outlet offering a diverse selection of meals with great value and high standards. Our approach is distinctive, providing a variety of exclusive tastes across three different lines—burgers, pasta, and potatoes—under the single banner of 3 Lines Group.

        As a legally registered Single Person Company (SPC) in the Kingdom of Bahrain, 3 Lines has successfully expanded its footprint across the nation. Our branches are strategically located in key areas, including Isa Town, Riffa, Arad, Busaiteen, Hamad Town, Jannusan, Juffair, and Saar, ensuring that our signature dishes are accessible to a wide range of customers.
        At 3 Lines, we are committed to delivering quick, healthy nourishment and efficient service, making us a popular choice for diners of all ages seeking quality meals in a welcoming environment. </p>
